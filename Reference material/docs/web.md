# Local web UI

The repository ships a small browser interface for browsing chapter
figures, animations, and scripts without leaving the local machine. It
is implemented in `src/active_inference/web/` and is a peer of the text
menu — both share the same discovery layer in
`src/active_inference/menu/runner.py`.

> The footer of every page links to the
> [Active Inference Institute](https://activeinference.institute/) and to
> [textbook-group.activeinference.institute](https://textbook-group.activeinference.institute/)
> for cohort registration. If you fork the UI, please keep that
> attribution.

## Launch

```bash
./run.sh --web                          # default http://127.0.0.1:8765/
./run.sh --web --no-browser             # don't auto-open the browser
./run.sh --web --port 8080              # custom port (ephemeral if taken)
uv run python -m active_inference.web   # equivalent
uv run active-inference-web --verbose   # PEP 621 console script
```

From inside the text menu (`./run.sh`), press `w` to start the same
server.

The server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default — the page is reachable only
from the local machine. Set `AIWEB_HOST=0.0.0.0` / `--host 0.0.0.0` to
expose it on the LAN (use cautiously: there is no authentication).

## What's on the page

The sidebar lists every detected chapter, every registry-backed extras topic,
and a small set of top-level docs (architecture, notation, cookbook, reading
order, uv workflow). Each chapter or extras tab is divided into the relevant
subset of:

1. **Figure gallery** — every PNG / GIF in
   `output/figures/chapter_<N>/`. Click a thumbnail to open the full
   file.
2. **Numbered examples & concept demos** — the scripts that mirror book
   examples. Each row has:
   - **Show command** — opens a dialog with the exact `uv run python`
     command to invoke the script by hand.
   - **Render** — POSTs to `/api/run`; the server runs the script with
     `--save` under `MPLBACKEND=Agg` and the gallery refreshes.
3. **Animations** — same pattern, for `animation_*.py`.
4. **Visualizations** — same pattern, for `visualize_*.py`.
5. **Interactive scripts** — scripts containing `interactive` in the
   name, including registry-backed extras launchers. The **Launch on host**
   button starts the slider window on the machine running the server.
6. **Chapter documentation** — links to the matching pages under
   `docs/chapters/`, `docs/topics/`, and `docs/statistics/`. Clicking
   a link renders the Markdown inside the same tab.

## HTTP surface

All endpoints return JSON unless otherwise noted.

| Method | Path                              | Purpose |
|--------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| GET    | `/`                               | SPA shell (HTML). |
| GET    | `/favicon.svg` (or `.ico`)        | Inline SVG favicon (mono with red dot). |
| GET    | `/static/app.css`, `app.js`       | Inline asset bundles. |
| GET    | `/api/index`                      | Chapters and extras with per-kind counts, subtitles, figure counts, and extras family/section metadata. |
| GET    | `/api/chapter/<N>`                | Scripts (with size, mtime, docstring, example number), figures (with size, mtime, dimensions, generated_by), inline-rendered README, and chapter doc links. |
| GET    | `/api/extra/<topic>`              | Extras scripts, figures, README HTML, family, summary, chapters, and book sections. |
| GET    | `/api/doc/<id>`                   | Rendered Markdown for one doc page. |
| GET    | `/figures/<NN>/<file>`            | Static file under `output/figures/`. |
| GET    | `/figures/extras/<topic>/<file>`  | Static file under `output/figures/extras/<topic>/`. |
| GET    | `/docs-raw/<path>`                | Static file under `docs/`. |
| POST   | `/api/run`                        | Render one chapter or extras script (non-interactive). |
| POST   | `/api/launch-interactive`         | Launch a slider script on the host. |

Every static path is canonicalized and rejected if it escapes its
allowed base directory.

## Design

- **Stdlib only.** Uses `http.server`, `socketserver`, `subprocess`,
  and a tiny Markdown converter built into `server.py`. No Flask, no
  Jinja, no JS framework, no CDN dependencies.
- **Single page, vanilla JS.** Tab switching, gallery rendering, the
  filter input, the lightbox, and the action menu are all in
  `templates.JS`.
- **Same discovery layer as the menu.** Both UIs converge on
  `active_inference.menu.runner.discover_chapters` and
  `discover_extras`; if you add a new chapter or registry-backed extras
  folder, both pick it up automatically.
- **Subprocess for execution.** The "Render" button reuses
  `active_inference.menu.runner.run_script`, so figures land in the
  same `output/figures/chapter_<NN>/` or `output/figures/extras/<topic>/`
  directory as the CLI workflows. Interactive extras launchers call tested
  shared constructors but do not write media. After rendering extras through
  the web UI, `uv run python scripts/validate_book_topic_coverage.py
  --require-rendered` checks registry declarations against the resulting
  PNG/GIF media and NPZ+JSON sidecars.

## Visual identity

- **Mono palette.** Pure black background, near-black panels
  (`#121212` / `#161616`), white / off-white text, gray chrome.
- **A single red accent (`#ef4444` family)**, used sparingly: the
  active sidebar tab, the **Render** button, the H2 accent bar, the
  `cached figures` metric, the favicon dot, error toasts, and the
  animation badge. Everything else is greyscale so the red keeps its
  signal value.
- **No purple / green / yellow / blue.** If you find yourself reaching
  for a new color, use a different *gray* tone instead.

## Power-user features

- Press <kbd>/</kbd> from any chapter tab to focus the filter input.
  Filter substrings match against script names, docstrings, figure
  filenames, and the script that generated each figure.
- Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to clear the filter, close a dialog, or close
  the lightbox.
- Click any figure to open the lightbox. Click the "generator" name
  in a figure caption to scroll to the script row that produced it
  (briefly highlighted in red).
- The **Command** button on each script row opens a copyable shell
  command — `Copy` puts it on the clipboard via the Async Clipboard
  API.
- If a render fails, the output dialog automatically opens with the
  last 25 lines of `stderr` (with a tab to view `stdout`).

## When to use which front end

| You want to… | Use |
|---|---|
| Re-render every figure for CI / a fresh checkout | `./run.sh --all` or `scripts/run_all_figures.py` |
| Pick a script from a quick keyboard menu | `./run.sh` |
| Browse generated figures alongside chapter docs | `./run.sh --web` |
| Embed discovery in another Python program | `from active_inference.menu.runner import …` |
| Embed the server in another Python program | `from active_inference.web import run_server` (with `block=False`) |

## Troubleshooting

- *"Port 8765 already in use"* — the server falls back to an ephemeral
  port automatically and prints the URL. To pin a specific port, kill
  the conflicting process (or pass `--port`).
- *"Launch on host" does nothing when accessed remotely* — interactive
  matplotlib windows need a display. Run the server on the machine
  whose display you want to use; SSH X-forwarding works too.
- *Figures don't refresh after Render* — the JS reloads the chapter
  tab on success. If the network panel shows `404 GET /figures/…`,
  the chapter script may have failed; click **Show command** and try
  running the script in the terminal to read the traceback.
