# AGENTS.md — Fundamentals of Active Inference (Python Companion)

This file guides AI assistants working with the Fundamentals of Active Inference
Python companion repository.

The project is open source and maintained by the
[Active Inference Institute](https://activeinference.institute/); ongoing
cohort-based textbook reading groups run at
[textbook-group.activeinference.institute](https://textbook-group.activeinference.institute/).
Keep that link present in user-facing docs and the web-UI footer if you
restructure them.

## Repository Overview

This repo provides a tested Python implementation of the algorithms described in
Sanjeev V. Namjoshi's *Fundamentals of Active Inference* (MIT Press, 2026),
plus thin orchestrator scripts that reproduce the figures and numerical examples
of Chapters 1–14 and source-map Appendix A-D coverage where executable.
Chapters 1–10 are the stable Part I/II spine; Chapters 11–14 are first-class
Part III companion implementations that must stay source-backed as manuscript
examples are audited into tests.

This repository ships **no LLM/code-generation stage**: every figure, raw-data
sidecar, notebook, and test in `output/` is produced by a script you run and a
library you can read. The intended workflow is deliberate practice — run an
orchestrator, observe the artifact, change a parameter, re-run — and the
validators exist to catch real gaps, not to be satisfied by patched output. See
[`docs/learn_by_hand.md`](docs/learn_by_hand.md) for the by-hand learning loop.

## Architecture

The codebase follows a two-layer architecture:

- **Layer 1 (library):** `src/active_inference/` — reusable, documented, tested
  classes and functions organized into six subpackages: `core`, `estimators`,
  `visualizations`, `utils`, plus the strict-UI peers `menu` (stdlib text
  menu) and `web` (stdlib local web server).
- **Layer 2 (orchestrators):** `chapters/chapter_01/` through
  `chapters/chapter_14/` plus `extras/<topic>/` and `demo/<slug>/` — thin scripts (≤ ~120
  lines each) that wire library components together to produce figures and
  numerical results.

All business logic lives in `src/`. Scripts orchestrate; they do not contain
domain logic.

## Ground Truth Sources

- **Source spine:** `src/active_inference/source_spine.py` records the inspected
  PDF as Chapters 1–14 and Appendices A-D, with no Chapter 15. Run
  `uv run python scripts/validate_source_spine.py --require-pdf` after edits
  that touch chapter/appendix source status.
- **Active chapter list:** Chapters 1–14 are present on disk; each chapter's
  non-interactive scripts are covered by smoke tests. Ch.1–10 are the stable
  declared scope; Ch.11–14 are PDF-grounded Part III companion demos and should
  not be described as manuscript-complete until source-backed worked-example
  tests exist.
- **Canonical import surface:** Defined in `src/active_inference/__init__.py`
  and its `__all__` list.
- **Notation mapping:** `docs/notation.md` maps every symbol to its Python
  identifier.
- **Architecture diagram:** `docs/architecture.md` contains the layered design
  and key types table.
- **Extras registry and provenance:** `src/active_inference/extra_topics.py`
  declares topic modes and source API references; `docs/reference/book_topic_matrix.md`
  and `docs/reference/orchestrator_provenance.md` document the coverage and
  source-method contracts.

## Conventions

- All variances are *variances*, not standard deviations.
- Densities are evaluated on 1-D NumPy grids; integration uses `np.trapezoid`.
- Every chapter, extras, and demo script accepts `--save` for headless rendering;
  stochastic scripts also accept `--seed` for reproducibility.
- With `--save`, every non-interactive chapter, extras, or demo script must produce
  both the visual artifact and at least one raw-data sidecar. Chapters write
  `output/data/chapter_NN/<stem>.npz` + `<stem>.json`; extras write
  `output/data/extras/<topic>/<stem>.npz` + `<stem>.json`; demos write
  `output/data/demo/<slug>/<stem>.npz` + `<stem>.json`. Use
  `save_chapter_data` / `save_extra_data` / `save_demo_data` directly for bespoke exports or the
  shared visualization save helpers for figure-derived exports.
- Random number generators are passed explicitly via `numpy.random.Generator`
  — no global state.
- Chapter, extras, and demo scripts import only from `active_inference`, the Python
  standard library, and the canonical scientific plotting dependencies already
  required by the script surface (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, and, where already
  needed by an existing workflow, `scipy`). They never import from other chapter
  or extras scripts. Keep domain logic in `src/active_inference/`; direct
  scientific imports in orchestrators are for CLI/rendering glue only.
- Extras JSON manifests include registry source API references for saved
  artifacts; update the registry and tests together when a topic's underlying
  method changes.
- `MPLBACKEND=Agg` is used in all CI and smoke-test contexts so no display is
  required.


## Orchestrator Contract Details

- `scripts/validate_orchestrator_contracts.py` is the executable gate for
  filename discovery, allowed imports, and non-interactive `--save` support.
  Use `--strict-warnings` only when intentionally turning soft debt into a
  blocking gate.
- Delegator wrappers such as `run.sh`, menu/web launchers, generated extras
  wrappers that call `main_visualize` / `main_simulate` / `main_animation`, and validator
  scripts are not chapter/extras orchestrators. They may import the internal
  `active_inference.menu`, `active_inference.web`, or validation helpers needed
  to dispatch or inspect workflows, but they should not contain domain logic.
- Shared helper scripts under `scripts/` should stay validator/maintenance
  oriented and stdlib-first. If they need numerical source behavior, import it
  from `active_inference` instead of reaching into chapter or extras wrappers.

## Testing

```bash
# Full suite (unit tests + chapter smoke tests)
uv run pytest                                # or: pytest

# Unit tests only — skip the slow subprocess smoke tests
uv run pytest tests/core tests/estimators tests/utils tests/visualizations

# Smoke tests (run every chapter script with --save)
uv run pytest tests/chapters -v

# Demo smoke tests
uv run pytest tests/demo tests/test_demo_workflows -v

# Validate generated raw-data sidecars
uv run python scripts/validate_raw_data_exports.py --root output/data --chapters 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
uv run python scripts/validate_raw_data_exports.py --root output/data --demos eye_saccades bicycle drone_flight

# Coverage

```

Coverage targets: 90%+ for `src/active_inference/` (excluding thin wrappers
that mainly glue imports).

## How to Add a New Example

1. Add a method or class to the appropriate `src/active_inference/` submodule
   (with corresponding unit tests in `tests/<sub>/`).
2. Create a thin orchestrator in the appropriate `chapters/chapter_<N>/`,
   `extras/<topic>/`, or `demo/<slug>/` directory (≤ ~120 lines; imports only from
   `active_inference`, stdlib, and narrowly scoped `numpy` / `matplotlib` /
   existing `scipy` rendering glue). Put reusable workflow logic in
   `src/active_inference/`, not in the wrapper.
3. Accept `--save`; add `--seed` whenever the script samples or otherwise
   depends on pseudo-randomness.
4. Document the script in the chapter or extras topic `README.md`.
5. Ensure `--save` writes reconstructable raw data. Prefer plotting through
   `save_or_show` / `save_animation`; if the script has non-plotted arrays,
   call `save_chapter_data(chapter, stem, arrays, metadata, figures=...)` for
   chapter scripts, `save_extra_data(topic, stem, arrays, metadata,
   figures=...)` for extras, or `save_demo_data(slug, stem, arrays, metadata,
   figures=...)` for demos.
6. The smoke tests and `active_inference.menu` discovery pick the file up
   automatically as long as it follows the `example_*.py` / `animation_*.py` /
   `visualize_*.py` / `interactive_*.py` / `0N_*.py` naming convention.
7. `scripts/run_all_figures.py` discovers the same way — no edit needed.

## Environment management

- The recommended workflow is `uv sync` + `uv run` (see
  [`docs/uv.md`](docs/uv.md)). Plain `pip install -e ".[dev]"` is still
  supported.
- `uv.lock` is committed; `.venv/` is git-ignored.
- After changing dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, run `uv lock` and
  commit the regenerated lockfile.
